  “Wow! This is so nice! I’m going to need some funny ghost writers. Any ideas?”
So I have to admit that today even 12 years after graduation, I’m still insecure about my own worthiness.
I have to remind myself today you’re here for a reason.
Today I feel much like I did when I came to Harvard Yard as a freshman in 1999 when you guys were, to my continued shock and horror, still in kindergarten.
I felt like there had been some mistake that I wasn’t smart enough to be in this company, and that every time I opened my mouth, I would have to prove I wasn’t just a dumb actress.
