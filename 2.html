  Hello, Class of 2015.
I am so honored to be here today.
Dean Khurana, faculty, parents, and most especially graduating students, thank you so much for inviting me.
The Senior Class Committee, it’s genuinely one of the most exciting things I’ve ever been asked to do.
I have to admit primarily because I can’t deny it as it was leaked in the WikiLeaks release of the Sony hack, that when I was invited, I replied, and I directly quote my own email,
“Wow! This is so nice! I’m going to need some funny ghost writers. Any ideas?”
So I have to admit that today even 12 years after graduation, I’m still insecure about my own worthiness.
I have to remind myself today you’re here for a reason.
