  Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for the last little while, I've been a model. Actually, for 10 years.
And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress.
So luckily, I brought an outfit change.
This is the first outfit change on the TED stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.
